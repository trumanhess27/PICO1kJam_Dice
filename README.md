# PICO1kJam_Dice
This project was created for the [PICO-1K Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pico-1k) on Itch.io.
The program is a dice roller for D4's, D6's, D8's, D10's, D12's and D20's to be used for table-top RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons.
Per the rules of the game jam, the program must be no longer than 1024 characters of code!
My program ended up consisting of 999 characters of code.

Some screengrabs and a GIF:
