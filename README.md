# PICO1kJam_Dice
This project was created for the [PICO-1K Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pico-1k) on Itch.io.
The program is a dice roller for D4's, D6's, D8's, D10's, D12's and D20's to be used for table-top RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons.
Per the rules of the game jam, the program must be no longer than 1024 characters of code!
